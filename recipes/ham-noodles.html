        <p>Fans of Ponyo will remember Ponyo's 
            obsession with food, especially her
            love for ham. The umami dish doesn’t
            have an official name, but it goes by
            a few monikers – such as ham noodles,
            Ponyo noodles, and Ponyo ramen. Here’s
            how you can level up your instant noodles
            with just 2 ingredients: </p>
